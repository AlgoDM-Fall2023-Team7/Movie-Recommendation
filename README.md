# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an advanced Movie Recommendation System, integrated with a Streamlit application. The system utilizes machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity.

## Project Overview

Our Movie Recommendation System is designed to enhance user experience by offering tailored movie suggestions. It leverages a Next Word Predictor, built using NLP techniques, to further refine recommendations based on patterns in movie titles.

### Key Features

- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Using content-based filtering methods.
- **Next Word Predictor**: Augments suggestions using NLP.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **VS Code**: For development and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the user interface.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install several Python libraries, including Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


## Usage

Input the title of a movie and the number of similar movies you want to receive as recommendations. The system will then display a list of movies similar to your input.
